# Token creation project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

To compile the smart contract run the following command:
```sell
npx hardhat compile
```

To test the smart contract run the following command
```shell
npx hardhat test
```

To deploy the Token.sol contract on hardhat's fake Blockchain run the following code:
```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
